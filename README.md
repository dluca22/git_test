# git_test
#this is my project following The Odin Project, and learning to goof around and learn trying my best not to ask for help

#so this will likely be a very confusing repository with many commits and pushes, but it is my second day learning from a total beginner that never ever even know about what github is and never touched a terminal

#this project, I hope, will bring me ( 32y.o.) to a path to become a developer/IT technichan, because i'm at a real low point in my manual worker career and really need to ensure a better future for myself and my daughter.

#if anyone ever checks this out, your help and tips on the vocabulary and dos and don'ts of coding/git will be much appreciated, thanks, happy learning!

#p.s.= leave a blank line, for structuring the code, got that, PLUS there is a "preview" function in VisualStudio, so maybe, use it.
